# Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
# Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about basketball players. The analysis includes data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization to derive insights about the players.

# Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

Name
Team
Number
Position
Age
Height
Weight
College
Salary

# Project Steps
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
Loaded the dataset using pandas.
Conducted an initial exploration to understand the structure and basic statistics.
2. Data Cleaning
Checked for and handled missing values.
Corrected the data in the "Height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180.
Removed duplicate rows.
3. Analysis and Visualization
   
# Performed various analyses and created visualizations to understand the data better.

a. Distribution of Employees Across Teams
Calculated the distribution of employees across each team.
Calculated the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
Created a bar chart to visualize the distribution.
b. Employee Segregation Based on Position
Segregated employees based on their positions within the company.
Created a bar chart to visualize the segregation.
c. Predominant Age Group Among Employees
Identified the predominant age group among employees.
Created a bar chart to visualize the age group distribution.
d. Team and Position with the Highest Salary Expenditure
Discovered which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
e. Correlation Between Age and Salary
Investigated the correlation between age and salary.
Created a scatter plot to visualize the correlation.

# Findings

Team Distribution: The dataset revealed the number of players in each team, with the New Orleans Pelicans having the highest number of players.
Position Segregation: The analysis showed the distribution of players across different positions, with Shooting Guards (SG) being the most common.
Age Group: The majority of players were in the 20-25 age group.
Salary Expenditure: The Miami Heat's Power Forwards (PF) had the highest salary expenditure.
Correlation: A weak positive correlation was found between age and salary.
Conclusion
The EDA provided insights into the distribution of players across teams and positions, the predominant age group, the team and position with the highest salary expenditure, and the correlation between age and salary.

# Visualizations
The following visualizations were created to support the analysis:
